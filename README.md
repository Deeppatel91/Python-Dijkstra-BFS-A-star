# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a Pygame-based visualization tool for three popular pathfinding algorithms: **A\* (A-star)**, **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. It allows users to interactively create grids, set start and goal positions, and visualize how each algorithm finds the shortest path.

## Algorithms Overview
### A* Algorithm
A* is a heuristic-based algorithm that combines the cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to the goal. It is highly efficient and guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
 BFS explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving to the next level. It guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
 Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path in weighted graphs by prioritizing nodes with the lowest cost. Unlike A*, it does not use a heuristic but ensures optimality in weighted scenarios.
